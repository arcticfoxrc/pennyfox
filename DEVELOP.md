### Branching Strategy

We follow a simplified version of Gitflow, which is well-suited for open-source projects:

*   **`main`**: This branch contains the stable, production-ready code. All releases are made from this branch.
*   **`develop`**: This is the main branch for active development. All new features and bug fixes should be merged into this branch.
*   **`feature/*`**: Feature branches are used for developing new features. They should be branched off from `develop` and merged back into `develop` when complete.
*   **`bugfix/*`**: Bugfix branches are used for fixing bugs. They should be branched off from `develop` and merged back into `develop` when the fix is verified.

### Contribution Guidelines

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the PennyFox repository to your GitHub account.
2.  **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix, following the naming convention (`feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/your-bug-fix`).
3.  **Make Changes**: Implement your changes, ensuring that the code is well-documented and follows our coding standards.
4.  **Test Your Changes**: Thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work as expected and don't introduce any new issues.
5.  **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
6.  **Create a Pull Request**: Create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the `develop` branch of the PennyFox repository.
7.  **Code Review**: Your PR will be reviewed by the project maintainers. Address any feedback and make necessary changes.
8.  **Merge**: Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the `develop` branch.
